Welcome to the beta version of **iDetrend** -- a Shiny app for interactively detrending tree-ring data. 

Standard descriptive statistics and plots are produced when data are uploaded or the example data box is checked.

On the second tab, you can cycle through each series and detrend it interactively. Note: Not all of the options in `detrend.series` are available.

The third tab contains the detrended data which can be downloaded as a text file.

[This project is on GitHub](https://github.com/OpenDendro/iDetrend/) as is [dplR](https://github.com/AndyBunn/dplR/).
